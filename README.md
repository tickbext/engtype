George Orwell’s life and work reflect a profound engagement with the political upheavals of the twentieth century, synthesizing personal experience and incisive critique into enduring literary landmarks. Born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in Motihari, British India, he served in the Imperial Police in Burma (1922–27), chronicled poverty in Paris and London (1933), fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936–37), and produced landmark essays on language and power before his death in 1950 . His 1945 novella *Animal Farm* allegorizes the Russian Revolution and Stalinism through characters like Napoleon the pig , while his 1949 dystopia *1984* explores totalitarianism, propaganda, and surveillance through Winston Smith’s doomed rebellion against Big Brother , . Orwell’s experiences—particularly in Spain and under imperial rule—informed his unwavering anti-totalitarian stance, articulated in essays such as “Why I Write” and in works like *Homage to Catalonia* . The mechanisms of power he depicted—Newspeak, doublethink, omnipresent telescreens—resonate today in debates over mass surveillance and data privacy, though modern “surveillance capitalism” often operates through private corporations rather than a singular state . Notably, Orwell’s only lifetime Italian translation was *Omaggio alla Catalogna* (1948), translated by Giorgio Monicelli, reflecting an early engagement between his work and Italian readers under Mussolini’s shadow . Central to *1984* is the insight “The object of power is power,” encapsulating a vision of authority that seeks domination for its own perpetuation rather than any ideological end .

## 1. Main Events in Orwell’s Life

### Early Years and Education

* Born Eric Arthur Blair on 25 June 1903 in Motihari, Bengal Presidency, to a lower-upper-middle-class family; educated at St Cyprian’s School and later won a scholarship to Eton College in 1917.
* Left Eton in 1921 without completing his certificate and joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma (1922–27), an experience that inspired *Burmese Days* and essays like “Shooting an Elephant” .

### Writing Career and Political Engagement

* Resigned from the Imperial Police in 1933 and lived in Paris and London, documenting poverty in *Down and Out in Paris and London* (1933) .
* Published *The Road to Wigan Pier* (1937) on working-class life and fought in the Spanish Civil War (1936–37) with the POUM, later chronicled in *Homage to Catalonia* (1938).

### World War II and Later Works

* Served in the BBC’s Eastern Service during WWII and published *Animal Farm* in 1945, satirizing Stalinism.
* Diagnosed with tuberculosis, he completed *Nineteen Eighty-Four* in 1949 and died on 21 January 1950 in London  .

---

## 2. *Animal Farm* (1945)

### Date and Allegorical Meaning

* Published on 17 August 1945 by Secker & Warburg in London, the novella uses a farm-rebellion narrative to allegorize the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the rise of Stalinism under Joseph Stalin  ,  .
* Orwell described it as “a satirical tale against Stalin” in correspondence and essays, aiming to expose the betrayal of revolutionary ideals.

### Main Character

* **Napoleon**: A pig who consolidates power through manipulation and violence, representing Stalin’s authoritarian regime; he gradually subverts the farm’s egalitarian principles into totalitarian rule.

---

## 3. Orwell as an Anti‑Totalitarian Voice

* Orwell’s firsthand experiences under imperial bureaucracy and in the Spanish Civil War radicalized him against all forms of totalitarianism, whether fascist or Stalinist.
* In *Why I Write* (1946), he asserted that since 1936 “every line of serious work… has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism,” underscoring his commitment to political purpose fused with artistic expression .
* His essays, notably “Politics and the English Language” (1946) and “The Prevention of Literature” (1946), dissect how totalitarian regimes manipulate language and intellectual freedom to consolidate power.

---

## 4. *Nineteen Eighty‑Four* (1949)

### Plot Overview

* Set in Airstrip One (formerly Britain), part of Oceania—a totalitarian superstate ruled by the Party under Big Brother—it follows Winston Smith, a Ministry of Truth worker who clandestinely rebels through a forbidden diary and a relationship with Julia, only to be crushed by the Thought Police.

### Key Characters

* **Winston Smith**: Protagonist, embodies the struggle for truth and individuality .
* **Julia**: Winston’s lover, rebels through personal pleasures rather than political ideology .
* **O’Brien**: Inner Party member who deceives Winston into betrayal .
* **Big Brother** and **Emmanuel Goldstein**: Symbolic figures central to Party propaganda and the Two Minutes Hate.

### War, Propaganda, and Totalitarian Regime

* Oceania is in perpetual, shifting war (with Eurasia or Eastasia), used to fuel nationalism and justify repression.
* The Ministry of Truth fabricates history, employs telescreens and Two Minutes Hate to enforce orthodoxy and crush dissent.

### Power and Domination

* The Party’s slogan “Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past” captures its historical revisionism.
* O’Brien’s dictum “The object of power is power” reveals that domination is an end in itself, unconstrained by morality or utility.

### Big Brother

* A possibly fictitious figurehead embodying the Party’s cult of personality; “Big Brother is watching you” symbolizes omnipresent surveillance.

### Newspeak and Doublethink

* **Newspeak**: A controlled language designed to eliminate subversive thought by reducing vocabulary and meaning.
* **Doublethink**: The capacity to accept contradictory beliefs simultaneously, e.g., to “declare war on Eurasia; to be at peace with Eastasia”.
* **Slogans**:

  1. “War is Peace”
  2. “Freedom is Slavery”
  3. “Ignorance is Strength”.
* **2 + 2 = 5**: The ultimate demonstration of Party control over objective reality, forcing acceptance of falsehood as truth.

## 5. Privacy: Orwell’s World vs. Today

### Similarities

* **Omnipresent Surveillance**: Telescreens in *1984* prefigure CCTV, smartphones, and smart-home devices that monitor citizens’ every move.
* **Propaganda and Data Manipulation**: The Ministry of Truth’s historical revisionism echoes modern “fake news” and algorithmic filtering on social media.

### Differences

* **State vs. Corporate Surveillance**: Orwell’s state monopoly on surveillance contrasts with today’s “surveillance capitalism,” where corporations like Google and Facebook collect personal data for profit and influence.
* **Voluntary Data Sharing**: Modern users often trade privacy for convenience (e.g., location services, IoT devices), a phenomenon absent in Orwell’s coercive regime.

### Examples

* **Edward Snowden Revelations**: Exposed state surveillance programs (e.g., PRISM), drawing parallels to *1984*’s Thought Police but demonstrating checks, judicial oversight, and public debate absent in Oceania.
* **Data Brokers and Targeted Advertising**: Corporations compile profiles to predict behavior, a “soft” form of control without overt violence .

## 6. Link Between Orwell and Italy

### Fascist Influence on Orwell’s Thought

* Orwell’s essays “What is Fascism?” (1944) and “Who Are the X?\_” critique Mussolini’s Italy as a paradigm of reactionary, anti-equality ideology, informing his broader anti-totalitarian critique.

### Italian Reception and Translation

* *Homage to Catalonia* was first translated into Italian (as *Omaggio alla Catalogna*) in December 1948 by Giorgio Monicelli, the sole lifetime translation, highlighting early Italian interest despite Mussolini’s fall.
* Postwar Italian intellectuals engaged with Orwell’s work as cautionary tales against residual fascist tendencies and emerging Cold War polarities.

## 7. “The Object of Power Is Power”

In Part 3, Chapter 3 of *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, O’Brien explains to Winston that true power is self‑perpetuating:

> “The object of power is power.”

This aphorism reveals that:

1. **Domination for Its Own Sake**: The Party seeks not material gain or ideological ends but the sheer capacity to control others indefinitely  .
2. **Perpetuation of Hierarchy**: By demanding absolute obedience and rewriting reality, the regime ensures its survival beyond any conventional goals of governance  .
3. **Erasure of Morality**: Power becomes an end unbounded by ethical constraints, legitimized only by its own exercise, epitomizing the novel’s dystopian vision of authority stripped of purpose beyond itself  .

  ## Samuel Beckett
  
  ### 1. Life
    *born in dublin in 1906, attended trinity colledge studying french and italian, 10 years after colledge Beckett setteled permanently in Paris (france).
    In paris he started his literary career as a short-story writer and novelist, shortly after he recieved a Nobel for Literature. Died (1989)
    
    His most famous works are:
      - Waiting for Godot (1952) -> influential play about the await of godot
      - Endgame           (1958) -> dissolution of the relationship between the physical and hte intellectual sides of a man at the very moment of death
      - Krapp's Last Tape (1958) -> monologue

      - Breath            (1969) -> shows how human life has become mere sounds, if not silence.

      Beckett is part of "The Theatre of the Absurd" which is defined by: 
      - The absence of a real story or plot
      - No actions (since all actions are insignificant).
      - Vagueness about time places and characters
      - Minimal use of language since it contradicts what the characters are doing
      - Incoherent babbling makes up the dialogue
---
  ###  2. Waiting For Godot
    This play has no setting besides a country road and a bare tree, time doesn't move (just the present).
    
    The plot revolves around two tramps whom are waiting for a mysterious Godot who never turns up.
    The structure is circular (comes around) it begins the same way it ends. The two acts are symmetrically built, the stage is divided into two halves by a tree.
    The human races are divided into two, Vladimir and Estragon.
    
    There are no characters in a traditional sense, two protagonists are Vladimir and Estragon who question themselves about the nature of the self, the world and God and represent the intelect.
    The two protagonists are complementary. There are other carachters, Lucky and Pozzo, they are physically linked by a rope and by a relationship of master and servant. 
    Estragon and Pozzo stand for the Body (?), the couples are mutually dependent.
    
    Themes:
    
    1. Dreariness and meaningless of human life
    2. A static world where nothing happends
    3. Absence of any traditional time (no past, no future, only repetetive present)
    4. Man's increased knowledge has only made him aware of the uselessness of his learning

    Style:

    1. Disintegration of language (broken and fragmented dialogue with absurd exchanges)
    2. Use of para-verbal language (mime, silence, gaps and pauses)
    3. A grotesque (ugly or stupid) humour
    4. The tone is tragic and desperate
